### About

I design and deploy **production ML systems** that optimize decisions in real time.  
My work spans **ranking models**, **bidding algorithms**, and **recommendation engines** —  
all serving at sub-second latency on the **Databricks** platform.

Recent projects improved network performance by **16%**, translating directly to measurable revenue.  
Most of my day revolves around **feature engineering at scale** (100+ attributes on Delta Lake),  
**exploration–exploitation systems** using **Thompson Sampling**, and  
**dynamic bidding** with **PID control loops** for stability under traffic shifts.

I care deeply about building **ML infrastructure that lasts** —  
observability pipelines, reproducible experiments, and governed deployment via **MLflow**.

### Prior Work

Previously at **Bed Bath & Beyond**, I built:
- Uplift modeling for personalized promotions  
- Collaborative filtering recommenders on 50M+ transactions  
- Churn prediction using survival analysis  

We proved — through experimentation — that digital channels could outperform direct mail.

### Outside Work

I sing and produce music, hike when I can get out of the city,  
and run a small data science book club with coworkers.  
The best ideas usually happen on long walks, not at my desk.
