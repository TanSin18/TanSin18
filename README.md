## About Me

I build intelligent systems that drive digital advertising at scale.  
Every day, my models process millions of interactions, deciding which ad to show, how much to bid,  
and when to explore new strategies.  

My work sits where **machine learning meets production engineering**:  
rankers that think fast, bidders that adapt, and pipelines that stay honest through feedback.

> I believe good systems don’t just predict. They *learn to stay right*.

## Systems That Keep Me Up (In a Good Way)

<div align="center">

<table>
<tr><td><b>Real-Time Ranking</b><br>Scoring pipelines that balance click-through rate, revenue, and latency — all under 100 ms.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Adaptive Bidding</b><br>Market-aware controllers that adjust campaign spend dynamically.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Feature Factory</b><br>Automated generation of 100+ behavioral and campaign-level features.</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Exploration Framework</b><br>Contextual bandit systems that turn experimentation into continuous learning.</td></tr>
</table>

## Experience

**Fluent Inc · Senior Data Scientist**  
Building adaptive optimization engines that power Fluent’s advertising marketplace.  
From model governance to real-time feedback loops, my work connects research, data, and performance.  

**Bed Bath & Beyond · Data Scientist**  
Developed uplift models for digital promotions, recommender systems for 50 M+ transactions,  
and churn prediction models for customer retention initiatives.

## Currently Exploring

- Integrating large-language-model tools into data science workflows for faster prototyping and debugging  
- Designing better monitoring and explainability systems for deployed ML models  
- Automating feature lineage tracking and evaluation across experiments

## Outside Work

I’m usually wandering through NYC coffee shops, sketching product ideas,  
or decoding film structures the way I dissect model behavior.  
Trilingual: English · Hindi · Marathi.  
Sometimes I sing, but mostly I build.
