# Tanmay Sinnarkar

**Senior Data Scientist @ Fluent Inc · NYC**

I build production ML systems that process **50M+ daily decisions** in real-time advertising.  
My work: **ranking algorithms**, **budget optimization engines**, and **exploration frameworks** that turn data into revenue.

## What I Build

**Real-Time ML Systems**  
Sub-400ms ranking pipelines serving 50M+ daily impressions. Every prediction matters when you're processing millions of ad decisions per day.

**Adaptive Optimization**  
PID-based budget controllers that dynamically adjust bids across 200+ campaigns. Systems that don't just predict—they adapt and optimize continuously.

**Exploration at Scale**  
Thompson Sampling and UCB frameworks that balance exploration vs exploitation, finding optimal strategies 3× faster while protecting revenue.

**Audience Intelligence**  
Recursive segmentation engines (Audience Miner 2.0) that discover high-value segments automatically, enabling 20-40% ROI improvements through data-driven targeting.
